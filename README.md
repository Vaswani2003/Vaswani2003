## Greetings! 👋
### I'm Vinamra Vaswani, a third-year Computer Science enthusiast deeply immersed in the world of coding and technology. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### As the Google DSC Lead and an active member of the GitHub community on campus, I've not only organized but also taken the stage as a spokesperson at numerous events.
### I've got plenty of LeetCode solutions and useful academic resources here. Feel free to use them, and I'd love to know if they've helped you out! 🌟

## 🚀 Quick Introduction

* 🔭 I consistently share Leetcode solutions, particularly catering to my C++ fam (because, let's be real, Java can be a bit too verbose).
* 🌱 Currently on the journey of mastering Web Development and delving into the realms of Machine Learning.
* 💬 Beyond tech, I find solace in reading philosophy and religious texts, I've travelled to a bunch of places and I'm always down for a hike.

* ⚡ Fun fact: Animals hold a special place in my heart! 🐾

# Feel free to explore my repositories, and I'd love to hear back if my contributions made a difference!

Happy coding! 🚀
